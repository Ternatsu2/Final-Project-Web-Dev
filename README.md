## Setting Up BugMe (For Developers)

Want to run BugMe locally or contribute to the project? Here's how:

1.  **Get XAMPP:** Download and install XAMPP, which provides Apache and MySQL.
2.  **Place the Project:** Copy the `bugme-issue-tracker` folder into your XAMPP's `htdocs` directory (usually `C:\xampp\htdocs\`).
3.  **Create the Database:**
    *   Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP.
    *   Open phpMyAdmin (usually at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`).
    *   Create a new database named `bugme`.
4.  **Import the Schema:** Import the `schema.sql` file (located in the project root) into the `bugme` database to create the necessary tables.
5.  **Configure the Database Connection:**
    *   Open the `db.php` file.
    *   Verify the database connection settings:
        ```php
        $host = 'localhost';
        $db = 'bugme';
        $user = 'root';
        $password = ''; // Change this if you have a MySQL password
        ```
    *   If you have a different MySQL password, update the `$password` variable in `db.php`.

## Using BugMe

1.  **Access the Application:** Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost/bugme-issue-tracker/index.php`.
2.  **Log In:** Use the default administrator credentials:
    *   **Email:** `admin@project2.com`
    *   **Password:** `password123`
3.  **Explore the Dashboard:** After logging in, you'll see the main dashboard (`home.php`).
4.  **Manage Users and Issues:** Use the sidebar links to add new users and create new issues.
5.  **Filter Issues:** Use the "ALL," "OPEN," and "MY TICKETS" buttons to filter the displayed issues. The filtering happens dynamically using AJAX, so the page won't reload.
